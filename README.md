The **bufferwizard** Emacs package offers a suite of helper functions:
- `(bufferwizard-toggle-highlight-at-point)`: Toggles highlighting for the symbol at point. If a selection is active, it highlights the selected text instead. This function checks whether the symbol at point or the selected text is currently highlighted. If it is, the highlight is removed; otherwise, it is applied. (This serves as a lightweight alternative to the `highlight-symbol` package.)
- `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)`: Replace occurrences of a symbol at point with a specified string.
- `(bufferwizard-clone-indirect-buffer)` and `(bufferwizard-clone-and-switch-to-indirect-buffer)`: These functions are enhanced versions of the built-in `clone-indirect-buffer`. They create an indirect buffer with the same content as the current buffer while preserving the point position, window start, and horizontal scroll position. This package also provides the `(bufferwizard-switch-to-base-buffer)` function, which allows switching from an indirect buffer to its corresponding base buffer.

## Installation

### Install with straight (Emacs version < 30)

To install `bufferwizard` with `straight.el`:

1. It if hasn't already been done, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package bufferwizard
  :ensure t
  :straight (bufferwizard
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/bufferwizard.el"))
```

### Installing with use-package and :vc (Built-in feature in Emacs version >= 30)

To install `bufferwizard` with `use-package` and `:vc` (Emacs >= 30):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package bufferwizard
  :ensure t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/jamescherti/bufferwizard.el"
       :rev :newest))
```

### Customizations

#### Case sensitivity

The functions `(bufferwizard-toggle-highlight-at-point)` and `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)` depend on built-in functions that can be customized via the following variable:

- `case-fold-search`: This buffer-local variable determines the behavior of `(bufferwizard-toggle-highlight-at-point)` and `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)`. When set to t (default), both symbol highlighting and searches become case-insensitive, matching symbols regardless of case. When set to nil, they become case-sensitive, matching symbols only when the case exactly matches the text in the buffer.
  Example:
  ```elisp
  ;; Setting case-fold-search to nil enables case-sensitive symbol highlighting
  ;; and search/replace
  (setq-default case-fold-search nil)
  ```

- `case-replace`: When non-nil, this variable ensures that `(bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point)` preserves the case of the original text during replacements.
  Example:
  ```elisp
  ;; t means (bufferwizard-replace-symbol-at-point) should preserve case in
  ;; replacements.
  (setq case-replace t)
  ```
